## Slope Game Remake

This repository is supposed to be a remake of Slope, an online endless runner game. The game is made with ![LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org) (the same framework Minecraft Java Edition) using Gradle and Java.

### How to Build
To build the project, you must have `gradle` installed. If you're on MacOS, I prefer you to use Homebrew via `brew install gradle`. On Windows, just install Gradle (https://gradle.org/install/) and set it up.

To build just run `gradle build` and after run `gradle run`.
